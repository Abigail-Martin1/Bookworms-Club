            <p>I remember starting this book with lots of optimism, due to the fact that Marissa Meyer, the author of this book, is one of my favorites. I had high expectations
                 and they were met. The beginning of the book starts off immediately with action, and it keeps you initially very interested. The premise of the story 
                  involves heroes and antiheroes, both of which believe they should rule the city of Gatlon. This  book is cool because there is a historical 
                   background that leads into where the story takes place. The city itself is a basic superhero ruled city, with smaller poorer outskirts. Some of the powers that
                    the author created are very original.Based on reading level I will admit that this book could be read by younger audiences like kids in middle school. So it’s 
                    definitely not hard to comprehend from a reading standpoint. This is not a book that you should read if you are looking for romance. It’s definitely a book 
                      you read to explore the sci-fi world that the author created. There is a little bit of violence in this trilogy which really keeps things  interesting. I think 
                      that my favorite thing about this first book is watching the main character Nova change her beliefs, and watching her struggle with what side she wants to be on. 
                      This truly is a story regarding perspectives and how those can affect everything in your own life.

            <img src="ACOTAR BOOK PHOTO.jpg" alt="Picture of A Court Of Thornes And Roses by Sarah J. Maas" class="center" width="50" height="800">
            <p>A Court of Thorns and Roses was wonderful to read. When I had started this series I was fairly new to reading. But this series truly kept me reading! This series is 
                written by one of my favorite authors, Sarah J Maas. I instantly fell in love with world building and character arcs. First of all, if you love high fantasy books with 
                a little bit of romance, this is definitely a series you would enjoy. The main character ends up in a new world and is unsure of her fate. With the help of her new
                 connections she is able to learn so much about the world around her. This book is a little dark at times but it all plays out beautifully and always keeps you engaged. 
                 I can say even after all the books I’ve read, this series has always stood out to me. I think what’s so cool about this book is the originality. This series plays out 
                 in a beautifully written world with intriguing scenery and some magical elements that create such a fun world to explore. I truly enjoyed watching the character
                  relationships change throughout this book. If you enjoy reading fantasy with elements of romance and a deeply entwined plot twist, this is definitely a book/series you 
                  should give a try!

            <p> This book was extremely difficult to put down. The characters are compelling in the sense that you want to understand what is making them feel the way that they feel. 
                The romance that was incorporated was endearing throughout this first book of the series. The plot remains fairly interesting throughout this book, and only makes you want
                 to keep on reading more and more in the story. The book itself includes interesting world building which sets up a dystopian world, with elements of sci-fi that create an
                  intriguing setting for the plot. The main character Juliette struggles a good bit with her mental health throughout this book, but she ends up learning a lot about her
                   own strengths and demonstrates significant growth. Other important characters are Adam and Warner. Both of these characters live different lives, but have connections
                    that they will later discover over the course of this series. The dynamic between these three characters is quite entertaining. I would recommend this book if you are
                     looking for a dystopian, easy read, with a little bit of romance. Overall I really enjoyed the pace, and it left me wanting to continue reading the series.</p>
